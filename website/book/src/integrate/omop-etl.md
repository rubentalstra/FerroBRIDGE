# The OMOP ETL

The OMOP side of FerroBRIDGE turns openEHR content into rows in an OMOP Common
Data Model v5.4 database, driven by OMOCL mapping files. OMOP is a relational
analytics schema rather than an API, so the deliverable is populated tables. It
is designed and not yet built.

## A batch job, not a listener

The ETL runs as a job over AQL. It queries the CDR with `POST /query/aql`,
converts each EHR's compositions through the loaded OMOCL files, and writes
typed CDM rows. It pulls; the CDR does not push.

That follows from the specification surface rather than from taste: change
notification is not part of openEHR ITS-REST 1.1.0, so there is nothing
conformant to subscribe to. If FerroBRIDGE later consumes a particular CDR's
change events, that is a FerroBRIDGE extension, labelled as one, and the batch
path stays the conformant baseline.

## The tables in play

PERSON, OBSERVATION_PERIOD, VISIT_OCCURRENCE, VISIT_DETAIL,
CONDITION_OCCURRENCE, DRUG_EXPOSURE, PROCEDURE_OCCURRENCE, DEVICE_EXPOSURE,
MEASUREMENT, OBSERVATION, DEATH, SPECIMEN, FACT_RELATIONSHIP, NOTE, and
NOTE_NLP, beside the vocabulary tables.

Some of those come from mappings and some are derived. PERSON rows come per
EHR. VISIT_OCCURRENCE comes from a configured AQL query grouped by `ehr_id` and
source. OBSERVATION_PERIOD and the ERA tables are derived rather than mapped,
the way the OMOCL reference engine derives them.

## The row types are generated

The CDM v5.4 row types and the DDL are generated from the OHDSI
`CommonDataModel` definitions, which publish the model in machine-readable
form. Nothing hand-transcribes a column list, and regenerating from a newer
definition set is a generator run rather than an editing session.

## Concept resolution is SQL, not terminology

A source code becomes a `concept_id` through the locally loaded OHDSI
vocabulary: the CONCEPT table, the `standard_concept` flag, the domain, and the
CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP "Maps to" traversal. This is SQL over the vocabulary
tables in the same database as the CDM rows. It never goes to the FHIR
terminology server, which is a different component serving the FHIR side.

An unmapped code lands as `concept_id = 0` with the source value kept in its
source column. The CDM defines `0` as "no matching concept", and keeping the
source value is what makes the gap auditable later.

## Validating OMOCL files

OMOCL publishes no JSON schema, so FerroBRIDGE authors one from the grammar
tables and the published mapping library, validates every file against it
before running anything, and offers that schema upstream. A mapping that fails
validation is refused at load time.

## What you need in place

A PostgreSQL CDM v5.4 database built from the OHDSI DDLs, an Athena vocabulary
export loaded into it, a CDR to read from, and the OMOCL files for the
archetypes you care about. The [deployment shape](../operate/deployment-shape.md)
page lists the neighbours in full.
